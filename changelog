BabaJS Changelog
================

Version 1.0.1
-------------
* fixed a bug in _ensureLocal - if the totalCount==0 then we return immidiatly
* add a method addTemplate - allowing developer to add one template at a time
* added a private _log method
* added a private _stringify method - this allows for browsers that have window.JSON to declare objects and array in code tags. For older browsers it is recomended to include a JSON lib to the project.
* fixed a bug in _compile - code tags that didn't had space between the tag and the code were not parsed correctly. i.e: <%return "a"%> 
* fixed a bug in _findVar - i remove code inside of (...) in var declerations. for example, var a=fn(q,w),r=4; produced vars=[a,w,r] so now it produce vars=[a,r]

Version 1.0.2
-------------
* updated AddTemplate method - if we already have the template we ignore the command.
* fixed bug with varriable and stacks in _evalLoopTag and _evalConditionTag - forgot to add the _stringify method.
* fixed a bug in _compile - had a bug that i didn't handle properly the ending tag of <%ENDIF%> and <%ENDLOOP%>

Version 1.0.3
-------------
* fixed a bug with variable declerations. added the _stack decleration on the top of the library. 

Version 1.0.4
-------------
* fixed a bug #2 - https://github.com/mrharel/babajs/issues/2 - loop breaks the template

Version 1.0.5
-------------
* fixed a bug with the variable findder:
	the following code broke the function:
		var a = {b:c,d:e};
		
Version 1.0.6
-------------
removed debugger from code.

Version 1.0.7
-------------
Added a security flag for assign and code tags (i.e. <% and <%= ):
the security flag tells BabaJS to escape the string according to the flag. s = low security which will escape <,>,",and ' 
and S = high security which will escape <,>,&,",',`,,!,@,$,%,(,),[,],{,},=, and +

Usage: all you need to do is to add the flag after the % sign like so: <%s return data.user_input%> or <%s= data.user_input> or <%S return data.user_input %>

Version 1.0.8
-------------
Full support of flags and hooks. this removed the support of previous version of the format <%s - now it is <%f(s) code %>
I'll add more documentation and examples in the readme file.
